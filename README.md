# Air Quality Predictor with Frontend (Assignment 3)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation and Setup

This application requires Python and Node.js. On Linux, you will need to make sure the packages for virtual environment creation are installed.

Once you have made sure those are installed:
1. Clone the repository:<br>
   `git clone https://github.com/marley195/COS30049_Assignment`
2. Change into the cloned repository's directory:
   `cd COS30049_Assignment`
3. Prepare the application by running the setup script:
   * `setup.bat` on Windows.
   * `sh setup.sh` on Mac OS or Linux.

## Launching

Launch the backend first:
1. Activate the Python virtual environment:
2. Change into the `backend` directory in the repo:<br>
   `cd backend`
3. Start the backend with:
   * `start.bat` on Windows.
   * `sh start.sh` on Mac OS or Linux.

In another terminal session, launch the frontend server. In the repository, run `npm start`. The webpage for the application will open automatically when it's ready.
